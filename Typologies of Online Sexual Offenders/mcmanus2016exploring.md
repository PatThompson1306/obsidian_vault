#### Summary
Exploratory study analysing 26 common communicative themes extracted via content analysis from online transcripts to determine if non-contact fantasy and contact-reality child sex offenders (CSOs) could be differentiated based on content. 

#### Key Points
The outcome showed that only the theme of discussing sexual relations with another adult was significantly more frequent among non-contact fantasy offenders, and there were no significant differences across the five higher-order thematic categories (e.g., Rapport, Child sexual interest).

#### Summary
Aimed to empirically differentiate between subgroups of online Child Sexual Exploitation Material Online Users (CSEMOs) using psychological and clinical variables, comparing them against conventional Child Sex Offenders (CSOs). 

#### Key Points
The results supported the distinction between fantasy-driven and contact-driven users, noting that Contact-Driven Users were more likely to endorse cognitive distortions, while Fantasy-Driven Users were characterised by intimacy deficits and intense use of deviant sexual material.

#### Summary
sought to identify key elements and propose a refined typology of online solicitation offenders by analysing offender chat logs, emails, and social network posts provided by ICAC task forces. 

#### Key Point
The resulting typology extended existing distinctions (like fantasy vs. contact) by identifying four types:

- cybersex-only offenders
- schedulers
- cybersex/schedulers
- buyers

...based on communication patterns from a sample concentrated mainly in South Carolina.

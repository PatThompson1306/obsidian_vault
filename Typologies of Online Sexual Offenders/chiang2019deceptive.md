#### Summary
Investigated the process of an offender cycling through multiple personas in naturally occurring conversations with genuine child victims, with the aim to visualise persona distinctions and compare communication themes with previous decoy data. 

#### Key Points
The analysis showed that the offender successfully indexed temporary micro-identity positions (like 'sexual aggressor') via choices in linguistic moves, but failed to index macro-identity categories (like gender) in a meaningful way.

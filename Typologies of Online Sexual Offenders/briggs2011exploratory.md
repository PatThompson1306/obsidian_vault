### Summary
Conducts an exploratory study of 51 individuals convicted of Internet-initiated sex offenses to develop a typology of chat room offenders. 

The outcome established a tentative new typology, distinguishing **Contact-driven offenders**, whose goal was an offline meeting, from **Fantasy-driven offenders**, who sought sexual climax during cybersex. 

The authors concluded that this group of Internet chat room offenders constitutes a separate group with less severe criminogenic factors compared to traditional sex offenders.

#### Key Points
Suggests it is unclear if online stings prevent incidents of child sexual exploitation and they may result in convictions of individuals who may never have abused a child.

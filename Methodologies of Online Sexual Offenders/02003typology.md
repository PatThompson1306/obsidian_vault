#### Summary
Research intended to develop a typology of "child cybersexploitation" and online grooming practices to clarify the scope of these activities. 

The paper outlines how existing and emerging technologies alter the parameters of paedophile activity and notes that grooming involves offenders exchanging information on targeting, viewing public profiles, and quickly moving to exclusive private chats.

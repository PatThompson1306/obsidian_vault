#### Summary
Focuses on the linguistic analysis of online grooming strategies used by child sex offenders to explore predatory sexual behaviour in computer-mediated environments. 

The purpose was to analyse the presence and frequency of specific strategies, derived from O’Connell’s theory of online grooming, using LIWC and manual content analysis across different conversation stages. 

#### Key Points
The study found that online offenders utilise strategies consistent with face-to-face grooming, although their patterns varied somewhat from the existing theoretical models.

#### Question

Consider review of the LWIC tool

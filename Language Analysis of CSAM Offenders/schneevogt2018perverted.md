#### Summary
Investigates the linguistic features of online groomers in transcripts from the _Perverted Justice_ (PJ) website, aiming to confirm whether overt persuasion and sexual extortion were truly absent in decoy conversations compared to real-victim conversations. 

#### Key Points
Analysis of 622 chat logs confirmed that overt persuasion was rare and explicit sexual extortion was absent in the PJ corpus, contrasting with real-victim data and suggesting that PJ transcripts are not a perfect proxy for naturally occurring child abuse conversations.

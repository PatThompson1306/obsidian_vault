#### Summary
Describes research that aimed to develop the Chat Analysis Triage Tool (CATT) using NLP and machine learning methods to analyse and compare chats between minors and contact-driven versus fantasy-driven offenders. 

The process involved meticulously annotating and verifying 271 chats based on whether the offender was a "show" (contact) or "no-show" (fantasy/terminated) to test the tool's efficacy in differentiating between offender types.
#### Key Points

CATT uses a text classification model that was trained to predict whether a child sex offender was contact-driven or fantasy-driven. **The model was trained on a dataset from Perverted Justice**
#### Questions

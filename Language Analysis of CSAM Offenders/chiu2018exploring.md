#### Summary
Used statistical discourse analysis (SDA) to explore methods for differentiating between contact-driven (CCSOs) and fantasy-driven (FCSOs) online sexual offenders based on their goal-motivated grooming tactics in chats with minors. 

#### Key Points
The exploratory results suggested that CCSOs are more likely than FCSOs to use first-person pronouns and emotion words, and that this communication was more likely to be reciprocated, supporting the idea that CCSOs use these tactics specifically to build trust for a physical meeting.
